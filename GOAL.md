Create a Greeting Script

---

Please create a simple TypeScript file named `hello.ts` in the `src` directory.
The script should export a function that returns "Hello, Elves!" and a main execution block that logs this message to the console.
Also, ensure that the project is initialized so that I can run it.

---

1. A file named `src/hello.ts` exists.
2. The file contains a function returning "Hello, Elves!".
3. Running the script (via ts-node or compiled js) outputs "Hello, Elves!" to the terminal.
